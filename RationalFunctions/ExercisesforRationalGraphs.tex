Suppose $r$ is a rational function.  You can graph the function $r$ using the following six-step procedure:

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find the domain of $r$.

\item  Reduce $r(x)$ to lowest terms, if applicable.\footnote{This helps us determine limits for the next step.}

\item  Determine the location of any vertical asymptotes or holes in the graph, if they exist. 

\item  Find the axis intercepts, if they exist.

\item  Analyze the end behavior of $r$.  Find the horizontal or slant asymptote, if one exists.

\item  Use a sign diagram and plot additional points, as needed, to sketch the graph.\footnote{It doesn't hurt to check for symmetry at this point, if convenient.}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}\label{rationalneedcalcfirst}
Example \ref{carefulanalysisneeded} showed us that the six-step procedure cannot tell us everything of importance about the graph of a rational function and that sometimes there are things that are easy to miss.  Without Calculus, we may need to use graphing utilities to reveal the hidden behavior of rational functions.  Working with your classmates, use a graphing utility to examine the graphs the rational function given.  Compare and contrast their features.  Which features can the six-step process reveal and which features cannot be detected by it?
