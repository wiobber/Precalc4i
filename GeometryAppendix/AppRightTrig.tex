\label{AppRightTrig}

The word `trigonometry' literally means `measuring triangles,'  so naturally most students' first introduction to trigonometry focuses on triangles.   This section focuses on \index{triangle ! right}\index{right triangle}  \textbf{right triangles}, triangles in which one angle measures $90^{\circ}$.  Consider the right triangle below, where, as usual, the  small square `$\! \! \! \! \! \! \qed$' denotes the  right angle, the  labels `$a$,' `$b$,' and `$c$'  denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ represent the (measure of) the non-right angles.  As you may recall, the side opposite the right angle is called the  \index{hypotenuse} \textbf{hypotenuse} of the right triangle.  Also note that since the sum of the measures of all angles in a triangle must add to $180^{\circ}$, we have $\alpha + \beta + 90^{\circ}= 180^{\circ}$, or $\alpha + \beta = 90^{\circ}$.  Said differently, the non-right angles in a right triangle are \textit{complements}.

We now state and prove the most famous result about right triangles:  \index{Pythagorean Theorem}\index{Theorem ! Pythagorean} \textbf{The Pythagorean Theorem}.

%% \colorbox{ResultColor}{\bbm

\begin{theorem} \label{PythagoreanTheorem} (\textbf{The Pythagorean Theorem}) The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sums of the squares of the other two sides.  More specifically, if $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two sides, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.


\end{theorem}


%% \ebm}

There are several proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem,\footnote{Including one by Mentor, Ohio native \href{http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-james-a-garfields-proof-of-the-pythagorean-theorem}{\underline{President James Garfield}}.} but the one we choose to reproduce here showcases a nice interplay between algebra and geometry.  Consider taking four copies of the right triangle below on the left and arranging them as seen below on the right.

It should be clear that we have produced a large square with a side length of $(a+b)$. What is also true, but may not be obvious,  is that the shaded quadrilateral is also a square.   We can readily see the shaded quadrilateral has equal sides of length $c$.  Moreover, since $\alpha + \beta = 90^{\circ}$, we get the interior angles of the shaded quadrilateral are each $90^{\circ}$.   Hence,  the shaded quadrilateral is indeed a square.

\smallskip

We finish the proof by computing the area of the of the  large square in two ways.  First, we square the length of its side: $(a+b)^2$.  Next, we add up the areas of the four triangles, each having area $\frac{1}{2} ab$ along with the area of the shaded square, $c^2$.  Equating these to expressions gives: $(a+b)^2 = 4 \left( \frac{1}{2} ab\right)+c^2$.  Since $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$ and $4 \left( \frac{1}{2} ab\right)  = 2ab$, we have $a^2+2ab+b^2 = 2ab + c^2$ or $a^2+b^2 = c^2$, as required.

It should be noted that the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is also true.  That is if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of sides of a triangle and $a^2+b^2 = c^2$, then $c$ the triangle is a right triangle.\footnote{We will prove this in Section \ref{TheLawofCosines} by generalizing the Pythagorean Theorem to a formula that works for \textit{all} triangles.}

\smallskip

A list of integers $(a,b,c)$  which satisfy the relationship $a^2+b^2 = c^2$ is called a  \index{Pythagorean triple}\textbf{Pythagorean Triple}.  Some of the more common triples are: $(3,4,5)$,  $(5,12,13)$, $(7,24,25)$, and $(8,15,17)$.   We leave it to the reader to verify these integers satisfy the equation $a^2+b^2 = c^2$ and suggest committing these triples to memory.

\smallskip

Next, we set about defining characteristic ratios associated with acute angles.  Given any acute angle $\theta$, we can imagine $\theta$ being an interior angle of a right triangle as seen below.

Focusing on the arrangement of the sides of the triangle with respect to the angle $\theta$, we make the following definitions:  the side with length $a$  is called the side of the triangle which is \index{side ! adjacent}\index{adjacent side} \textbf{adjacent} to  $\theta$ and the side with length $b$ is called the side of the triangle \index{side ! opposite}\index{opposite side}\textbf{opposite} $\theta$. As usual, the side labeled `$c$' (the side opposite the right angle) is the hypotenuse.  Using this diagram, we  define three important \index{ratios ! trigonometric}\index{trigonometric ratios} \textbf{trigonometric ratios} of $\theta$.

\smallskip

%% \colorbox{ResultColor}{\bbm

\begin{definition} \label{righttrianglesinecosinetangent}    Suppose $\theta$ is an acute angle residing in a right triangle as depicted above.

\begin{itemize}

\item  The \index{sine ! right triangle} \textbf{sine} of $\theta$, denoted $\sin(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\sin(\theta) = \dfrac{b}{c}$, or $\dfrac{\text{`length of opposite'}}{\text{`length of hypotenuse'}}$.

\item  The \index{cosine ! right triangle} \textbf{cosine} of $\theta$, denoted $\cos(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\cos(\theta) = \dfrac{a}{c}$, or $\dfrac{\text{`length of adjacent'}}{\text{`length of hypotenuse'}}$.

\item  The \index{tangent ! right triangle} \textbf{tangent} of $\theta$, denoted $\tan(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\tan(\theta) = \dfrac{b}{a}$, or $\dfrac{\text{`length of opposite'}}{\text{`length of adjacent'}}$.\

\end{itemize}

\smallskip

\end{definition}

%% \ebm}

\smallskip

For example, consider the angle $\theta$  indicated in the triangle below on the left.  Using Definition \ref{righttrianglesinecosinetangent},  we get $\sin(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$, and $\tan(\theta) = \frac{4}{3}$.   One may well wonder if these trigonometric ratios we've found for $\theta$ change if the triangle containing $\theta$ changes.  For example, if we scale all the sides of the triangle below on the left by a factor of $2$, we produce the  \index{similar triangle}\index{triangle ! similar} \textbf{similar triangle} below in the middle.\footnote{That is, a triangle with the same `shape' - that is, the same angles.}  Using this triangle to compute our ratios for $\theta$, we find $\sin(\theta) = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and $\tan(\theta) = \frac{8}{6}  = \frac{4}{3}$.  Note that the scaling factor, here $2$, is common to all sides of the triangle, and, hence, cancels from the numerator and denominator when simplifying each of the ratios.

In general, thanks to the  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_postulate}{\underline{Angle Angle Similarity Postulate}},  any two \textit{right} triangles which contain our angle $\theta$ are similar which means there is a positive constant $r$ so that the sides of the triangle are $3r$, $4r$, and $5r$ as seen above on the right.  Hence, regardless of the right triangle in which we choose to imagine $\theta$,  $\sin(\theta) = \frac{4r}{5r} = \frac{4}{5}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3r}{5r} = \frac{3}{5}$, and $\tan(\theta) = \frac{4r}{3r}  = \frac{4}{3}$.  Generalizing this same argument to any acute angle $\theta$ assures us that the ratios as described in Definition \ref{righttrianglesinecosinetangent} are independent of the triangle we use.

\smallskip

Our next objective is to determine the values of $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$ for some of the more commonly used angles.  We begin with $45^{\circ}$.  In a right triangle, if one of the non-right angles measures $45^{\circ}$, then the other measures $45^{\circ}$ as well.  It follows that the two legs of the triangle must be congruent.  Since we may choose any right triangle containing a $45^{\circ}$ angle for our computations, we choose the length of one (hence both) of the legs to be $1$.  The Pythagorean Theorem gives the hypotenuse is:  $c^2 = 1^2+1^2 = 2$, so $c = \sqrt{2}$. (We take only the positive square root here since $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse here, so, necessarily $c>0$.)  From this, we obtain the values below, and suggest committing them to memory.

\item  $\cos\left(45^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} =\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$


\item  $\tan\left(45^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1$

\end{itemize}


\end{multicols}

Note that we have `rationalized' here to avoid the irrational number $\sqrt{2}$ appearing in the denominator.  This is a common convention in trigonometry, and we will adhere to it unless extremely inconvenient.  

\smallskip

Next, we investigate $60^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$ angles.  Consider the equilateral triangle below  each of whose sides measures $2$ units.  Each of its interior angles is necessarily $60^{\circ}$, so if we drop an altitude, we produce two $30^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ triangles each having a base measuring $1$ unit and a hypotenuse of $2$ units.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the height, $h$ of these triangles: $1^2+h^2 = 2^2$ so $h^2 = 3$ or $h = \sqrt{3}$.  Using these, we can find the values of the trigonometric ratios for both $60^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$.  Again, we recommend committing these values to memory.

\begin{itemize}

\item  $\sin\left(60^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

\item  $\cos\left(60^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2}$

\item  $\tan\left(60^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}$

\end{itemize}

\columnbreak


\begin{itemize}

\item  $\sin\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2}$

\item  $\cos\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

\item  $\tan\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$

\end{itemize}


\end{multicols}

Since $30^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$ are complements, the side \textit{adjacent} to the $60^{\circ}$ angle is the side \textit{opposite} the $30^{\circ}$ and the side \textit{opposite}  the $60^{\circ}$ angle is the side \textit{adjacent} to the $30^{\circ}$ .  This sort of `swapping' is true of all complementary angles and will be generalized in Section \ref{MoreTrigonometricIdentities}, Theorem \ref{cofunctionidentities}.

\smallskip

Note that the values of the trigonometric ratios we have derived for $30^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, and $60^{\circ}$ angles are the \textit{exact} values of these ratios. For these angles, we can conveniently express the exact values of their sines, cosines, and tangents  resorting, at worst, to using square roots.    The reader may well wonder if, for instance, we can express the exact value of, say, $\sin\left(42^{\circ}\right)$ in terms of radicals.  The answer in this case is `yes'  (see \href{https://math.la.asu.edu/~surgent/mat170/Exact_Trig_Values.pdf}{\underline{here}}), but, in general, we will not take the time to pursue such representations.\footnote{We will do a little of this in Section \ref{MoreTrigonometricIdentities}.}  Hence, if a problem requests an `exact' answer involving $\sin\left(42^{\circ}\right)$, we will leave it written as `$\sin\left(42^{\circ}\right)$'  and use a calculator to produce a suitable approximation as the situation warrants.

Our first example requires the concept of an `angle of inclination.'  The \index{angle ! of inclination} angle of inclination (or \index{angle ! of elevation} angle of elevation) of an object refers to the angle whose initial side is some kind of base-line (say, the ground), and whose terminal side is the line-of-sight to an object above the base-line.  Schematically:

\end{center}

\begin{example} \label{righttriangleex1} $~$

\begin{enumerate}

\item  The angle of inclination from a point on the ground 30 feet away to the top of Lakeland's Armington Clocktower\footnote{Named in honor of Raymond Q. Armington, Lakeland's Clocktower has been a part of campus since 1972.} is  $60^{\circ}$.  Find the height of the Clocktower to the nearest foot.

\item  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) stipulates the incline on an accessibility ramp be $5^{\circ}$.  If a ramp is to be built so that it replaces stairs that measure 21 inches tall, how long does the ramp need to be?  Round your answer to the nearest inch.

\item  In order to determine the height of a California Redwood tree, two sightings from the ground, one 200 feet directly behind the other, are made.  If the angles of inclination were $45^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, respectively, how tall is the tree to the nearest foot?

\end{enumerate}

{\bf Solution.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  We can represent the problem situation using a right triangle as shown below on the left.  If we let $h$ denote the height of the tower, then we have $\tan\left(60^{\circ}\right) = \frac{h}{30}$.  From this we get an exact answer of $h = 30 \tan\left(60^{\circ}\right) = 30 \sqrt{3}$ feet.  Using a calculator, we get the approximation  $51.96$ which, when rounded to the nearest foot, gives us our answer of $52$ feet.

\item  We diagram the situation below on the left using $\ell$ to represent the unknown length of the ramp.  We have $\sin\left(5^{\circ} \right)= \frac{21}{\ell}$ so that $\ell = \frac{21}{\sin\left(5^{\circ} \right)} \approx 240.95$ inches.  Hence, the ramp is $241$ inches long.

Finding the height of a California Redwood

Luckily, we have two right triangles to help us find each unknown, as shown below. From the triangle below on the left, we get $\tan\left(45^{\circ}\right) = \frac{h}{x}$.  From the triangle below on the right, we see  $\tan\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \frac{h}{x+200}$.

Since $\tan\left(45^{\circ}\right) = 1$, the first equation gives $\frac{h}{x} = 1$, or $x = h$.  Substituting this into the second equation gives $\frac{h}{h+200} = \tan\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.  Clearing fractions,  we get $3h = (h+200) \sqrt{3}$.  The result is a linear equation for $h$, so we  expand the right hand side and gather all the terms involving $h$ to one side.

\[ \begin{array}{rcl}

3h & = & (h+200)\sqrt{3} \\ [5pt]
3h & = & h \sqrt{3} + 200 \sqrt{3} \\ [5pt]
3h - h \sqrt{3} & = & 200 \sqrt{3} \\ [5pt]
(3-\sqrt{3}) h & = & 200 \sqrt{3} \\ [5pt]
h & = & \dfrac{200\sqrt{3}}{3-\sqrt{3}} \approx 273.20 \\ \end{array} \] 


Hence, the tree is approximately $273$ feet tall.  \qed

There are three more trigonometric ratios which are commonly used and they are defined in the same manner the ratios in Definition \ref{righttrianglesinecosinetangent} are defined.  They are listed below.

\begin{definition} \label{righttriangletherest}

Suppose $\theta$ is an acute angle residing in a right triangle as depicted on page \pageref{righttranglediagram}.

\begin{itemize}


\item  The \index{cosecant ! right triangle} \textbf{cosecant} of $\theta$, denoted $\csc(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\csc(\theta) = \dfrac{c}{b}$ , or $\dfrac{\text{`length of hypotenuse'}}{\text{`length of opposite'}}$.

\item  The \index{secant ! right triangle} \textbf{secant} of $\theta$, denoted $\sec(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\sec(\theta) = \dfrac{c}{a} $ , or $\dfrac{\text{`length of hypotenuse'}}{\text{`length of adjacent'}}$.

\item  The \index{cotangent ! right triangle} \textbf{cotangent} of $\theta$, denoted $\cot(\theta)$ is defined by the ratio: $\cot(\theta) = \dfrac{a}{b} $ , or $\dfrac{\text{`length of adjacent'}}{\text{`length of opposite'}}$.

\end{itemize}

We practice these definitions in the following example.

\begin{example} \label{righttriangleex2}  Suppose $\theta$ is an acute angle with $\cot(\theta) = 3$.  Find the values of the remaining five trigonometric ratios:  $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, $\tan(\theta)$, $\csc(\theta)$, and $\sec(\theta)$.

{\bf Solution.}  We are given $\cot(\theta) = 3 $.  So, to proceed, we construct a right triangle in which the length of the side adjacent to $\theta$ and the length of the side opposite of $\theta$ has a ratio of $3 = \frac{3}{1}$.  Note there are infinitely many such right triangles - we have produced two below for reference.  We will focus our attention on the triangle below on the left and encourage the reader to work through the details using the triangle below on the right to verify the choice of triangle doesn't matter.

From the diagram, we see immediately $\tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}$, but in order to determine the remaining four trigonometric ratios, we need to first find the value of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem gives $1^2 + 3^2 = c^2$ so $c^2 = 10$ or $c = \sqrt{10}$.   Rationalizing denominators, we find $\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10}$, $\csc(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{1} = \sqrt{10}$ and $\sec(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{3}$.  \qed


\end{example}

While we learned all about the trigonometric ratios of $\theta$ in Example \ref{righttriangleex2}, the identity of $\theta$ remains unknown.  Since $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{10} \approx 0.316 $ is decidedly less than $\sin\left(30^{\circ}\right) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, it stands to reason that $\theta < 30^{\circ}$. It turns out the calculator can provide for us a decimal approximation of $\theta$ by way of the `$\sin^{-1}(x)$' function.  Here, the `$-1$' exponent denotes an inverse function (see Section \ref{InverseFunctions}) does \textbf{not} mean reciprocal.\footnote{That is, $\sin^{-1}(x) \neq \frac{1}{\sin(x)} $.  That being said, $(\sin(x))^{-1} = \frac{1}{\sin(x)} = \csc(x)$.}  That is, $\sin^{-1}(x)$ (read `sine-inverse of $x$') gives an angle whose sine is $x$.  Hence, we may write $\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}\right) \approx 18.43^{\circ}$.  The functions $\cos^{-1}(x)$ and $\tan^{-1}(x)$ work similarly.  Indeed, \[ \theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}\right)  = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3 \sqrt{10}}{10}\right)  = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right),\] and the reader is encouraged to use a calculator to verify these statements.

\smallskip

Please note there is \textbf{much} more to these inverse functions than the `angle finder' description use here.\footnote{See Section \ref{TheInverseTrigonometricFunctions} for all of the pedantic details.}  That being said, we finish this section showcasing a use for the $\tan^{-1}(x)$ function below.

\begin{example}\footnote{The authors would like to thank Dan Stitz for this problem and associated graphics.} \label{roofpitchex}  The roof on the house below has a  `$6/12$ pitch'.  This means that when viewed from the side, the roof line has a rise of 6 feet over a run of 12 feet.  Find the angle of inclination from the bottom of the roof to the top of the roof. Round your answer to the  nearest hundredth of a degree.

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{cc}

\includegraphics[width=2.75in]{./AppRightTrigGraphics/AppRightTrig01.jpg} &
\hspace{0.75in} \includegraphics[width=2in]{./AppRightTrigGraphics/AppRightTrig02.jpg}  \\ 
Front View &  \hspace{0.75in} Side View \\

\end{tabular} 

\end{center}

{\bf Solution.} If we divide the side view of the house down the middle, we find that the roof line forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $6$ feet and $12$ feet as depicted below.  


\begin{center}

\begin{mfpic}[15]{0}{13.25}{-1}{6}
\polyline{(11.25,0), (11.25,0.75), (12,0.75)}
\arrow \reverse \arrow \polyline{(0,-1),(12,-1)}
\gclear \tlabelrect[cc](6,-1){$12$ feet}
\arrow \reverse \arrow \polyline{(13.25,0),(13.25,6)}
\gclear \tlabelrect[cc](13.25,3){$6$ feet}
\arrow \reverse \arrow \parafcn{3, 19, 5}{2.75*dir(t)}
\tlabel[cc](3.25,0.65){$\theta$}
\penwd{1.25pt}
\polyline{(0,0), (12,0), (12,6), (0,0)}
\end{mfpic}


\end{center}

The angle of inclination, $\theta$, satisfies $\tan(\theta) = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$.  Hence,  $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)  \approx 26.56^{\circ}$. \qed
